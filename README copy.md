# Solid.js in JavaScript

Template for Solid, using JavaScript.

Want to use TypeScript? [There's a template for that, too!](https://replit.com/@boxsupremacy/Solid-TypeScript?v=1)

This repl runs `npm run dev` when starting it, but in production, use the `npm run build` command in the Shell, and set the repl start command to `npm run serve`.

Dependencies should be installed, but if not, run:

```bash
$ npm install
```
